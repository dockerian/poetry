## Poetry Notes

- **syllable** `= [consonant] + vowel + [consonant]`
  A syllable consists of a vowel sound that may be preceded or followed by consonant sounds.
- **alliteration**: the repetition of initial consonant sounds, as in "tried and true", "safe and sound", "fish and fowl", "rime or reason".
- **assonance**: the repetition of vowel sounds, as in "mad as a hatter", "time out of mind", "free and easy", "slapdash".
- **consonance**: the repetition of final consonant sound, as in "first and last", "odds and ends", "short and sweet", "a stroke of luck", "struts and frets".
- **rime** (rhyme): the repetition of the accented vowel sound and all succeeding sounds.
  - **masculine**: the rime sounds involve only one syllable, as in "decks and sex", "support and resort".
  - **feminine**: the rime sound involve two or more syllables, as in "turtle and fertile", "spitefully and delightfully".
  - **internal rime**: one or more riming words are with the line.
  - **end rime**: the riming words are at the ends of line.
  - **slant rime** (approximate rime): words with any kind of sound similarity, from close to fairly remote. Slant rhyme include alliteration, assonance, and consonance or their combination when used at the end of the line.
  - **half-rime**: feminine rimes in which only half of the word rimes -- the accented half, as in "lightly and frightful", or the unaccented half, as in "yellow and willow".

- **refrain**: the repetition of whole words, phrases, lines, or groups of lines according to some fixed pattern, e.g. "spring and winter".

## Books List

* "A Little Book on Form: An Exploration into the Formal Imagination of Poetry" - Robert Haas

* "All the Fun’s in How You Say a Thing: An Explanation of Meter and Versification" - Timothy Steele

* "An Introduction to Poetry", by X. J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia (both poets themselves), best introductory textbook (written for college students). It’s very good, and very thorough, but it’s pretty expensive (college textbook), unless you can find a previous edition in a used bookstore.

* "Answering Back: Living poets reply to the poetry of the past" ­edited by Carol Ann Duffy. If you’re looking to kick a creative block, this anthology by the former Poet Laureate might just do the trick.

  > It features a selection of popular modern-day poets (like Simon Armitage, Seamus Heaney and emerging poets like Helen Mort, to name a few) responding to certain works of classic poets (think Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Tennyson).
  > Each poet was tasked with choosing any poem that compelled them in some way and responding to it with one of their own. Some of the works are clearly direct responses to the themes and ideas presented in the original poems whilst others are more subtle and offer a new perspective. It’s an exercise that can really help stir up some inspiration to write, and it’s one that Carol Ann Duffy tasks viewers of her online poetry course to do too.

* "Donald Justice's Compendium" is based on the syllabus for his form class at the Iowa Writers Workshop. Each chapter has accompanying exercises and I found it invaluable.

* "How to Read a Poem: And Fall in Love with Poetry" by Edward Hirsch: Hirsch offers readers a guide to appreciating and engaging with poetry. He explores different poetic elements and techniques while providing examples from a wide range of poets, helping readers develop their skills in reading and interpreting poems.
"The Poet's Companion: A Guide to the Pleasures of Writing Poetry" by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux: This book serves as a practical guide and source of inspiration for aspiring poets. It covers topics such as generating ideas, revising drafts, and navigating the publishing process, while also including writing exercises and prompts.

* "How to write poetry: A guided journal with prompts" by Christopher Salerno and Kelsea Habecker

  > Hungry to get writing immediately? Packed with writing prompts and exercises, Salerno and Habecker’s book should have you writing from the moment you pick it up.
  > The workbook encourages writers to crack open their creativity – prompting them to assess rhyme and meter, language and form in innovative ways in the hope to craft something compelling. If you’re a beginner, it’s a great guide to help you get into the habit of writing regularly. And for those poetry experts, it may help provide a new framework to inspire your next great idea.

* "In the Palm of Your Hand: The Poet's Portable Workshop" by Steve Kowit, has a lot of really great prompts. Kowit's book is a practical and engaging guide to writing poetry. It offers exercises, techniques, and examples to help writers explore various poetic elements and strengthen their craft.

* "The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms" edited by Mark Strand and Eavan Boland: This anthology explores a wide range of poetic forms and provides in-depth explanations of each form along with representative poems. It is a valuable resource for understanding the structure and techniques used in different poetic forms. ++

  > akin to a masterclass, offering a window into the artistry behind poetry. It's an indispensable map for those who wish to explore the myriad poetic forms and their evolution over time. If you have read Fry’s Ode Less Travelled, and have found yourself enthralled by the craft of poetry, from form to metre, then this is a great next step up. While it provides just a succinct overview of the technical aspects of each form, its true strength lies in offering a wealth of examples that demonstrate these techniques in action. Additionally, it enriches the learning experience with engaging historical context for each form or metre, blending education with storytelling.

* "Mapping the Heart" by the poet Wesley McNair. Wesley has been on the Pulitzer Committee for Poetry many times, reading and evaluating who will win the Pulitzer for that given year. He’s also a teacher and an important American poet.

* "Mary Oliver's A Poetry Handbook" is probably my favorite, and it's super-accessible. Known for her evocative poetry, Mary Oliver provides a concise and accessible guide to reading and writing poetry. She explores various aspects, including imagery, sound, and form, and shares her wisdom on how to deepen one's understanding and appreciation of poetry. +++

  > If it’s some gentle beginner’s guidance on how to write a poem you’re after, Mary Oliver should be able to provide you with what you’re looking for with this useful handbook.
  > Here you’ll find her breakdown of poetry’s basics – from different poetic forms and language techniques to practical tips on the creative process – like the importance of workshopping your pieces and the value solitude can bring to your writing too.
  > The latter is something many poets swear by, including Carol Ann Duffy. “I’ve learnt to value silence. I’ve learnt to value thinking, reading, contemplating, rather than rushing straight to the blank page,” she says in her BBC Maestro poetry course.

* "Melodious Guile: Fictive Pattern in Poetic Langauge" - John Hollander

* "The New Book of Forms" - Lewis Turco

* "The Ode Less Travelled: Unlocking the Poet Within" by Stephen Fry: In this entertaining and informative book, Stephen Fry introduces readers to the art of writing poetry. He covers different forms, rhyme schemes, and techniques while encouraging readers to embrace their creativity and enjoy the process of writing poetry. ++

* "The Poet's Manual" by Frances Stillman. This comprehensive guide traverses various forms and techniques, laying a solid foundation for understanding poetry's vast landscape. It's a lighthouse for anyone navigating the sometimes turbulent waters of poetic expression. I always take this out and keep it by my side for it’s extensive collection of rhymes, so if I ever get stuck, this baby right here is my towing rope dragging me out of my rhythmic ditch.

* "The Poetry Handbook: A Guide to Reading Poetry for Pleasure and Practical Criticism" by John Lennard: This comprehensive guide provides readers with tools to understand and analyze poetry. It covers various aspects, including form, meter, rhyme, and poetic devices, offering practical exercises and examples.

* "The Poetry Home Repair Manual", by Ted Kooser, is similarly approachable, in a somewhat grandfatherly way. Very re-readable and affirming at times. Ted Kooser is a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and former United States poet laureate. It’s a really good, accessible, “reader-friendly” book (and it’s short, and inexpensive too!). Not dry and “academic” at all. It’s really designed for total beginners (although experienced poets can get something out of it, too, I think). I think you’d find it very helpful. It’s a good place to start, and you can go from there. And by all means, read as much really good poetry as you can. No one who never read the best poets of all time ever wrote good poetry. (Start with the basics, like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, E. E. Cummings, Anne Sexton—and many others!) +++

* "The Poetry Home Repair Manual: Practical Advice for Beginning Poets" by Ted Kooser: This book offers practical guidance and inspiration for aspiring poets. It covers topics such as finding ideas, refining language, and developing one's unique voice, while providing examples and exercises to help readers improve their craft.
"The Triggering Town: Lectures and Essays on Poetry and Writing" by Richard Hugo: In this collection of essays, Hugo shares insights into the creative process, encouraging writers to find inspiration from their surroundings, memories, and personal experiences. It offers valuable perspectives on generating ideas and crafting meaningful poetry.

* "Poetry in the Making" by Ted Hughes.

  > Now, this book is not so much a ‘How to Write Poetry’ book. At Least that isn't why it made it to this video. The reason this is an honourable mention is because 1) Much like the precious book, this has an incredible array of poems in it which are used to demonstrate what Hughes is talking about. But the biggest reason this book is here is because it talks about certain aspects of the poet’s lifestyle. For example, how to think like a poet and how to write about people, and landscapes.

* "Poetry Writer's Handbook", by Sophia Blackwell, offers a beacon for contemporary poets. This handbook is replete with modern insights and practical advice for today's poetic adventurers, from developing your unique voice to finding your place in the literary world. This book is for the more career-driven poet. If you’re a hobbyist poet, this may not make it into your library, but if you’re looking to make a name for yourself in the community, or even go as far as becoming a working or career poet, then this is an absolute must-have and I’d be surprised if you had any questions that weren’t answered in here.

* "Poetic Meter and Poetic Form" - Paul Fussell

* "The Poets Companionship: A Guide to the Pleasures of Writing Poetry" by Kim Addonizio and Doiranne Laux

  > For those poets who need a confidence boost from time to time, this book may well be your new trusty companion.
  > Expect to come across a range of brilliant essays on all things poetry, like forming exciting ideas and navigating classic poetry techniques. At the same time, many appreciate this book for its comforting approach to the entire writing poetry process – acknowledging the inevitable self-doubt, the challenges of writing in a hyper-digital era and the forever rocky stability of a writing career. Even better – it encourages you to tackle it all at your own pace too.
  > Even if you have no idea where to start, hopefully, there’s something in here to help get you going. Remind yourself of the reasons why writing poetry interests you. Maybe you’re looking for a new way to express your thoughts and ideas, or you feel you have something important to say.
  > If so, remember the words of Carol Ann Duffy, “the poet must feel that they have something to give,” says Carol Ann. Keen to learn more? Take a look at her BBC Maestro course, Writing Poetry.

* "The Practice of Poetry: Writing Exercises From Poets Who Teach" edited by Robin Behn and Chase Twichell: This anthology features writing exercises and prompts from renowned poets. It provides a range of approaches and perspectives on the craft of writing poetry, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced poets.

  > Whether you’re working on your second anthology, or this is the first time you’re coming to the pages, Lockward’s The Practicing Poet is the perfect companion for poets of all levels.
  > In this poetry book, you’ll find ten sections that break down different parts of the writing process. From helping writers generate their own ideas and tackling the editing process to getting your work published, it contains practical advice for each stage of the journey you can bring to your work – whether it's love poetry, dark poetry or another genre that excites you.

* "The Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms" - multiple editions with various editors.

* "Rhyme’s Reason" - John Hollander

* "The Vintage Book of Contemporary Poetry", edited by J. D. McClatchy. (another “textbook” I require for my beginning poetry rewriting class)
