* 高晓松：越过山丘

  ```
  越過山丘，遇見十九歲的我
  戴着一雙白手套，喝着我的喜酒
  他問我幸福與否，是否永別了憂愁
  為何婚禮上那麼多人，沒有一個當年的朋友
  我說我曾經挽留，他們紛紛去人海漂流
  那個你深愛的小妞，嫁了隔壁的王某
  我問她幸福與否，她哭着點了點頭
  後來遇見過那麼多人，想對你說卻張不開口

  就讓我隨你去，讓我隨你去
  回到二十歲狂奔的路口，做個形單影隻的歌手
  就讓我隨你去，讓我隨你去
  逆着背影婆娑的人流，向着那座荒蕪的山丘，揮揮衣袖

  越過山丘，遇見六十歲的我
  拄着一根白手杖，在聽鳥兒歌唱
  我問他幸福與否，他笑着擺了擺手
  在他身邊圍繞着一群，當年流放歸來的朋友
  他說你不必挽留，愛是一個人的等候
  等到房頂開出了花，這裡就是天下
  總有人幸福白頭，總有人哭着分手
  無論相遇還是不相遇，都是獻給歲月的序曲

  就讓我隨你去，讓我隨你去
  去到六十歲停下的渡口，等着被一條小船接走
  就讓我隨你去，讓我隨你去
  隨着熙熙攘攘的人流，向着開滿鮮花的山丘，揮揮衣袖

  越過山丘，遇見十九歲的我
  戴着一雙白手套，喝着我的喜酒
  他問我幸福與否，是否永別了憂愁
  為何婚禮上那麼多人，沒有一個當年的朋友

## English Songs

* All Too Well (_Taylor Swift_)

  ```
  You call me up again just to break me like a promise,
  so casually cruel in the name of being honest.
  ```

* Always Remember Us This Way (_Lady Gaga_)

  ```
  Lovers in the night
  Poets tryin' to write
  We don't know how to rhyme
  But, damn, we try
  But all I really know
  You're where I wanna go
  The part of me that's you
  will never die
  ```

* Another Love (_Tom Odell_)

  ```
  I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
  But it’s so cold and I don’t know where
  I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
  But they won’t flower like they did last spring

  And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
  I’m just so tired to share my nights
  I wanna cry and I wanna love
  But all my tears have been used up
  ```

* Cherry Wine (_Andrew Hozier-Byrne_)

  ```
  The way she tells me I’m hers and she is mine
  Open hand or closed fist would be fine
  The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
  ```

* Flower Power (_Greta Van Fleet_)

  ```
  Electric gold our love with tender care
  Hills of satin grass and maidens fair
  ```

* I’ll Stand By You (_Chrissie Hynde_)

  ```
  When the night falls on you
  You don’t know what to do
  Nothing you confess
  Could make me love you less
  ```

* Killing Me Softly (_Norman Gimbel_ & _Charles Fox_)

  ```
  He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
  And then he looked right through me as if I wasn’t there.
  ```

* Old Money (_Lana Del Rey_)

  ```
  Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
  Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
  Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
  ...
  The power of youth is on my mind
  Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
  Will you still love me when I shine
  ```

* On & On & On (_Caamp_)

  ```
  Standing on the edge with you,
  all the things we said we'd do.
  All the freckles on your face,
  tell me of your storied grace.
  ```

* Scarborough Fair (_Simon_ & _Garfunkel_)

  ```
  Are you going to Scarborough Fair
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
  Remember me to one who lives there
  She once was a true love of mine

  On the side of a hill in the deep forest green
  Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown
  Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
  Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

  Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
  Without no seams nor needle work
  Then she’ll be a true love of mine

  On the side of a hill in the sprinkling of leaves
  Washes the grave with silvery tears
  A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
  Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

  Tell her to find me an acre of land
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
  Between the salt water and the sea strands
  Then she’ll be a true love of mine

  War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
  Generals order their soldiers to kill
  And to fight for a cause they have long ago forgotten

  Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
  And gather it all in a bunch of heather
  Then she’ll be a true love of mine
  ```

* Someone Like You (_Adele_)

  ```
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
  I wish nothing but the best for you, too
  Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
  ```

* Skyfall (_Adele_)

  ```
  This is the end
  Hold your breath and count to ten
  Feel the Earth move, and then
  Hear my heart burst again
  For this is the end
  I've drowned and dreamt this moment
  So overdue, I owe them
  Swept away, I'm stolen
  ```
