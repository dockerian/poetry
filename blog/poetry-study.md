## Poetry Notes

<a name="concepts"></a>
### Basic concepts

- **monosyllabic**: all words are of one syllable.
- **syllable** `= [consonant] + vowel + [consonant]`
  A syllable consists of a vowel sound that may be preceded or followed by consonant sounds.

- **alliteration**: the repetition of initial consonant sounds, as in "tried and true", "safe and sound", "fish and fowl", "rime or reason", and "better buy better butter before bitter butter".
- **assonance**: the repetition of vowel sounds, as in "mad as a hatter", "time out of mind", "free and easy", "slapdash".
- **consonance**: the repetition of final consonant sound, as in "first and last", "odds and ends", "short and sweet", "a stroke of luck", "struts and frets".
- **refrain**: the repetition of whole words, phrases, lines, or groups of lines according to some fixed pattern, e.g. "spring and winter".

- **accentuation**: alterations in pitch as with variations in stress (to emphasize).
  * stress may change according to the meaning or nature of the word, e.g.
    - “He in**clines** to pro**ject**” vs “A **pro**ject to study the **in**clines”
    - “He pro**ceeds** to re**bel**” vs “The **re**bel steals the **pro**ceeds”

- **cae·su·ra** /səˈZHo͝orə,səˈzo͝orə/: a break, commonly a "comma", between words within a metrical foot (as a line of verse).

- **en·jamb·ment** /inˈjambmənt,enˈjam(b)mənt/: (_noun_, in verse) the continuation of a sentence without a pause beyond the end of a line, couplet, or stanza.

- **hen·dec·a·syl·la·ble** /henˌdekəˈsiləbəl/: a line of verse containing eleven syllables.

- **pitch**: sound going up and down; the degree of highness or lowness of a tone.

* poetic **foot**
  > in English, poetic feet are limited to six: iamb; trochee; spondee; dactyl; anapest; and pyrrhic. (The last is sometimes disputed.)

  - **i·amb** /ˈīˌam(b)/: a metrical foot consisting of a short (or unaccented, unstressed) syllable followed by a long (or accented, stressed) syllable. `- /`【抑扬格,长短格】
    ex: _impossible_
  - **trochee** /ˈtrōˌkē/: a backwards **iamb**, a falling rhythm, a metrical foot consisting of one long (or accented, stressed) syllable followed by one short (or unaccented, unstressed) syllable. `/ -`【扬抑格,短长格】
    ex: _dreadful_, _helpless_
  - **spondee** /ˈspänˌdē/: is of equal stressed units, a metrical foot consisting of two long (or accented, stressed) syllables. `/ /`【长长格】

    ex: _chracteristically_, _hendeca·syllabic_, _indianapolis_
  - **antibacchius** /ˌantibəˈkʌɪəs/: rarely used, two accented syllables followed by one unaccented syllable. `/ / -`【长长短】
  - **amphimacer**, **cretic** /ˈkrēdik/: one short or unstressed syllable between two long or stressed ones. `/ - /`【长短长】

- **limerick** /ˈlɪmərɪk/: a form of verse written in five-line, predominantly **anapestic** and **amphibrach** **trimeter** with a strict rhyme scheme of `- / - - / - - /`, in which the 1st, 2nd and 5th line rhyme, while the 3rd and 4th lines are shorter (e.g. `- / - - /`) and share a different rhyme. see [poets.org](https://poets.org/glossary/limerick) or [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)).

- **scansion**: scanning a poem for "meter", the number of feet in a line.

  - **internal rime**: one or more riming words are with the line.
  - **end rime**: the riming words are at the ends of line.
  - **slant rime** (approximate rime): words with any kind of sound similarity, from close to fairly remote. Slant rhyme include alliteration, assonance, and consonance or their combination when used at the end of the line.
  - **half-rime**: feminine rimes in which only half of the word rimes -- the accented half, as in "lightly and frightful", or the unaccented half, as in "yellow and willow".

### Poetry Scansion

<a name="stress-shift"></a>
#### Stress Shift Examples in Poetry Scansion

**Sentence Stress**: *Meaning-driven emphasis overrides natural stress*

  | Category | Natural Stress | Example Line & Poet | Scansion in Context | Explanation |
  |:---------|--|--|--|-------|:-----|
  | `blessed` | BLESS–ed (adj.) | "**BLESS–ed** are the meek" (Bible) | `BLESS–ed` (trochee) | Adjective: natural trochee. |
  | | bless–ÉD (v.) | "God **bless–ÉD** the child" (Blake) | `bless–ÉD` (iamb) | Verb shifts stress to suffix for emphasis. |
  | `compact` | COM–pact (n.) | "A **COM–pact** of trust" (Milton) | `COM–pact` (trochee) | Noun: stress on first syllable. |
  | | com–PACT (adj.) | "Things **com–PACT** and dense" (Donne) | `com–PACT` (iamb) | Adjective: stress shifts to second syllable. |
  | `content` | con–TENT (adj.) | "Are you **con–TENT**?" (Neutral) | `con–TENT` (iamb) | Adjective: natural iamb preserved. |
  | | CON–tent (n.) | "The **CON–tent** of his rage" (Shakespeare) | `CON–tent` (trochee) | Noun form demands initial stress. |
  | `rebel` | RE–bel (n.) | "The **RE–bel** stands alone" (Byron) | `RE–bel` (trochee) | Noun: initial stress. |
  | | re–BEL (v.) | "Why **re–BEL** against the king?" (Yeats) | `re–BEL` (iamb) | Verb: stress shifts to second syllable. |

**Metrical Demand**: *Meter forces stress shift to fit pattern* [&uArr;](#stress-shift)

  | Category | Natural Stress | Example Line & Poet | Scansion in Context | Explanation |
  |:---------|--|--|--|-------|:-----|
  | `above` | a–BOVE (iamb) | "The sky **a–BOVE**" (Shelley) | `a–BOVE` (iamb) | Natural iamb preserved. |
  | | A–bove (forced) | "**A–bove** the storm" (Tennyson) | `A–bove` (trochee) | Line-start trochaic substitution in iambic verse. |
  | `divine` | di–VINE (iamb) | "A thing **di–VINE**" (Shakespeare) | `di–VINE` (iamb) | Natural iamb. |
  | | DI–vine (forced) | "**DI–vine** Com–e–dy" (Dante trans.) | `DI–vine` (trochee) | Trochaic inversion to fit epic meter. |
  | `winter` | WIN–ter (trochee) | "**WIN–ter** winds" (Coleridge) | `WIN–ter` (trochee) | Fits trochaic line naturally. |
  | | win–TER (forced) | "When **win–TER’s** chill descends" (Keats) | `win–TER’s` (iamb) | Iambic pentameter forces stress to second syllable. |
  | `July` | Ju–LY (iamb) | "In **Ju–LY’s** heat" (Wordsworth) | `Ju–LY’s` (iamb) | Natural iamb fits iambic meter. |
  | | JU–ly (forced) | "**JU–ly** comes with thunder" (Frost) | `JU–ly` (trochee) | Trochaic substitution at line start for emphasis. |

**Adjacent Words**: *Strong neighbors demote/promote syllables* [&uArr;](#stress-shift)

  | Category | Natural Stress | Example Line & Poet | Scansion in Context | Explanation |
  |:---------|--|--|--|-------|:-----|
  | `forgotten` | for–GOT–ten (anapest) | "The **for–GOT–ten** child" (Rossetti) | `for–GOT–ten` (anapest) | Natural anapest. |
  | `forgot` | for–GOT (iamb) | "She **LONG** **for–GOT** **LOST** dreams" (Auden) | `for–GOT` (iamb) | Sandwiched between stressed syllables (`LONG`, `LOST`), "for-" becomes unstressed. |
  | `heaven` | HEAV–en (trochee) | "**HEAV–en’s** gate" (Milton) | `HEAV–en’s` (trochee) | Natural trochee. |
  | | heav–EN (iamb) | "And **heav–EN** **SHINES**" (Herbert) | `heav–EN` (iamb) | Stressed "SHINES" forces stress shift to "-en". |
  | `over` | O–ver (trochee) | "**O–ver** the hill" (Blake) | `O–ver` (trochee) | Natural trochee. |
  | | o–ver (iamb) | "The bridge **o–VER** **THERE**" (Stevens) | `o–VER` (iamb) | Stressed "THERE" demotes "o-" to unstressed. |

**Elision/Liaison**: *Syllables merge or vanish* [&uArr;](#stress-shift)

  | Category | Natural Stress | Example Line & Poet | Scansion in Context | Explanation |
  |:---------|--|--|--|-------|:-----|
  | `ever` | EV–er (trochee) | "**E’er** since that hour" (Burns) | `E’er` (1 syll. `/`) | Elided to 1 syllable to fit iambic foot: "E’er" = stressed. |
  | `the ocean` | the O–cean (3 syll.) | "**Th’O–cean’s** roar" (Pope) | `Th’O–cean’s` (2 syll.: `/– –/`) | "The" + "ocean" → 2 syllables: "th’O-" (stressed), "-cean’s" (unstressed). |
  | `over` | O–ver (trochee) | "**O’er** the hills" (Scott) | `O’er` (1 syll. `/`) | Elision → 1 stressed syllable. |

**Function Words**: *Typically unstressed, but stressed for meter* [&uArr;](#stress-shift)

 | Category | Natural Stress | Example Line & Poet | Scansion in Context | Explanation |
  |:---------|--|--|--|-------|:-----|
 | `and` | Unstressed | "The sea **and** sky" (Byron) | `and` (`–`) | Naturally unstressed. |
 | | Stressed | "**AND** the **STARS**!" (Whitman) | `AND` (`/`) | Starts a line; emphasized for dramatic trochee. |
 | `the` | Unstressed | "**The** moon ascends" (Wordsworth) | `the` (`–`) | Normally unstressed. |
 | | Stressed | "**THE** **KING** is dead!" (Tennyson) | `THE` (`/`) | Capitalization/metrical stress for emphasis. |
 | `to` | Unstressed | "**To** be or not" (Shakespeare) | `to` (`–`) | Unstressed in iambic foot. |
 | | Stressed | "**TO** **DIE**, to sleep" (Shakespeare) | `TO` (`/`) | Stressed for spondaic substitution (`TO DIE`). |
 | `that` | Unstressed | "I know **that** sound" (Eliot) | `that` (`–`) | Unstressed. |
 | | Stressed | "**THAT** **TIME** of year" (Shakespeare) | `THAT` (`/`) | Trochaic inversion at line start. |
 | `of` | Unstressed | "Sonnet **of** the Moon" (Marlowe) | `of` (`–`) | Typically weak. |
 | | Stressed | "**OF** **MAN’S** dis–o–bed–i–ence" (Milton) | `OF` (`/`) | Stressed for spondaic effect (`OF MAN’S`).                                  |

#### Key Insights: [&uArr;](#stress-shift)

**Fluidity is Fundamental**:
  - A word’s metrical identity (iamb/trochee/etc.) depends on its **position**, **neighbors**, and the **meter’s needs**.
  - Example: "winter" is trochaic alone but becomes iambic in iambic pentameter.

**Elision Alters Reality**:
   - Written syllables ≠ spoken syllables. "Th’ocean" (2 syllables) vs. "the ocean" (3).

**Ambiguity is Intentional**:
  - Lines like "**FI–er** or **FIRE**?" (Sonnet 153) allow dual scansions. Poets exploit this for rhythmic tension.

**Function Words Bend**:
  - Words like "and," "the," or "of" are **stress-chameleons**—unstressed by default but promoted for emphasis or meter.

### Stress Shift Examples (by Copilot)

**Sentence Stress Manipulation**
  _Words normally spoken with one stress pattern may shift due to intonation, emphasis, or inversion in syntax—especially at the start of a sentence or phrase._

 | Word | Natural Stress | Altered Foot | Example Phrase | Altered Contextual Foot |
  |:-----|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
 | and | × | / | And then it fell—like glass! | Strong beat, spondee |
 | go | × | / | Go now, before the sky can burn! | Command tone → stress |
 | here | × | / | Here she comes! | Adverb = heavy stress |
 | how | × | / | How did you not know? | Interrogative punch |
 | let | × | / | Let him run! Let him run! | Repetition = emphasis |
 | today | × / | / × | Today, we rise | Trochee (for emphasis) |
 | what | × | / | What will you do? | Emphatic use |
 | when | × | / | When? Tell me when! | Stressed monosyllable |
 | where | × | / | Where have you been? | Question word stress |
 | will | × | / | Will you not speak? | Spondee or trochee start |

**Metrical Context / Structure Accommodation**  [&uArr;](#stress-shift-copilot)
  _A word adjusts stress to conform with surrounding metrical requirements, especially in strict meters like iambic pentameter or anapestic trimeter._

 | Word | Natural Stress | Altered Foot | Example Phase | Intended Meter Context |
  |:-----|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
 | again | × / | / × | Again and again, he spoke the vow | Trochaic kickoff |
 | allow | × / | / × | Allow the stars to catch your breath | Emphasis alters foot |
 | awaken | × × / | × / × | Awakened, she saw day’s first light | Suppress initial syll. |
 | before | × / | / × | Before the river fell asleep | Trochee intro |
 | behold | × / | / × | Behold the fire inside the hill! | Dramatic stress shift |
 | beneath | × / | / × | Beneath the stone, a memory clings | Metrical inversion |
 | complete | × / | / × | Complete your task before the dawn | Trochee substitution |
 | perhaps | × / | / × | Perhaps you thought it would begin | Rhetorical shift |
 | repeat | × / | / × | Repeat this once: “I shall not yield.” | Trochee preference |
 | return | × / | / × | Return, my love! | Inversion at line start |

**Adjacent Word Effect** [&uArr;](#stress-shift-copilot)
  _Stress pattern shifts due to how neighboring words distribute emphasis, particularly in densely packed syntactic constructions._

 | Word | Natural Stress | Altered Foot | Example Phrase | Contextual Shift |
  |:-----|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
 | distance | / × | × / | A distance none could comprehend | Stress shift after determiner |
 | enter | / × | × / | To enter in that world of flame | Syntax delays stress |
 | follow | / × | × / | To follow dreams we dared to name | Complement attraction |
 | honest | / × | × / | An honest voice within the storm | Modifier weakens stress |
 | interest | / × | × / | An interest he forgot to claim | Leading article delays stress |
 | nothing | / × | × / | Of nothing shall you hear again | Meter absorbs emphasis |
 | offer | / × | × / | I offer silence, not regret | Syntactic inversion |
 | reason | / × | × / | The reason falls away with dust | Unstressed lead balances |
 | warning | / × | × / | No warning slipped into her dream | First beat absorbs stress |
 | winter | / × | × / | In winter’s fog, she watched the flame | “In” deflects stress |

**Ambiguity & Performance-Driven Variations** [&uArr;](#stress-shift-copilot)
  _Words with soft or dual stress may morph based on reader interpretation, rhythm, or dramatic delivery._

 | Word | Natural Stress | Altered Foot | Example Phrase | Performance Context |
  |:-----|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
 | always | / × | × / | Always they run, but never stay | Irony flips stress |
 | colorful | / × × | × × / | The colorful roar of light returns | Delayed lift |
 | even | / × | × / | Even now, she wonders why | Rhetorical pause |
 | every | / × | × / | Every time the clock would cry | Meter dominance |
 | heaven | / × | × / | To heaven’s edge, we throw our doubt | Rising cadence |
 | holiday | / × × | × × / | Holiday comes, but never stays | Compressed foot structure |
 | maybe | / × | × / | Maybe it’s just another lie | Mood modulation |
 | never | / × | × / | Never again, not now, not ever | Triple meter flexibility |
 | question | / × | × / | A question you forgot to ask | Pause intensifies lift |
 | woman | / × | × / | A woman’s voice behind the screen | Dramatic compression |

### Excerpt

* The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.

* Each English word is given its own weight and push as we speak it within a sentence. A word quantity is essentially the sum of the duration of its vowels.

* The rhythms of English poetry are ordered by **syllabic accentuation**, those of French more by **quantitative measure**.

* The freedom and the ease with which a master can do belies immense skill derived from practice.

* "**An Introduction to Poetry**", by *X. J. Kennedy* and *Dana Gioia* (both poets themselves), best introductory textbook (written for college students). It’s very good, and very thorough, but it’s pretty expensive (college textbook), unless you can find a previous edition in a used bookstore.

* "**Answering Back** - Living poets reply to the poetry of the past" ­edited by *Carol Ann Duffy*. If you’re looking to kick a creative block, this anthology by the former Poet Laureate might just do the trick.

  > It features a selection of popular modern-day poets (like Simon Armitage, Seamus Heaney and emerging poets like Helen Mort, to name a few) responding to certain works of classic poets (think Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Tennyson).
  > Each poet was tasked with choosing any poem that compelled them in some way and responding to it with one of their own. Some of the works are clearly direct responses to the themes and ideas presented in the original poems whilst others are more subtle and offer a new perspective. It’s an exercise that can really help stir up some inspiration to write, and it’s one that Carol Ann Duffy tasks viewers of her online poetry course to do too.


* "**Donald Justice's Compendium**" is based on the syllabus for his form class at the *Iowa Writers Workshop*. Each chapter has accompanying exercises and I found it invaluable.

* "**How to Read a Poem** - And Fall in Love with Poetry" by *Edward Hirsch*: Hirsch offers readers a guide to appreciating and engaging with poetry. He explores different poetic elements and techniques while providing examples from a wide range of poets, helping readers develop their skills in reading and interpreting poems.

* "**How to write poetry** - A guided journal with prompts" by *Christopher Salerno* and *Kelsea Habecker*

  > Hungry to get writing immediately? Packed with writing prompts and exercises, Salerno and Habecker’s book should have you writing from the moment you pick it up.
  > The workbook encourages writers to crack open their creativity – prompting them to assess rhyme and meter, language and form in innovative ways in the hope to craft something compelling. If you’re a beginner, it’s a great guide to help you get into the habit of writing regularly. And for those poetry experts, it may help provide a new framework to inspire your next great idea.


* "**In the Palm of Your Hand** - The Poet's Portable Workshop" by *Steve Kowit*, has a lot of really great prompts. Kowit's book is a practical and engaging guide to writing poetry. It offers exercises, techniques, and examples to help writers explore various poetic elements and strengthen their craft.

* "**The Making of a Poem** - A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms" edited by *Mark Strand* and *Eavan Boland*: This anthology explores a wide range of poetic forms and provides in-depth explanations of each form along with representative poems. It is a valuable resource for understanding the structure and techniques used in different poetic forms. ++

  > akin to a masterclass, offering a window into the artistry behind poetry. It's an indispensable map for those who wish to explore the myriad poetic forms and their evolution over time. If you have read Fry’s Ode Less Travelled, and have found yourself enthralled by the craft of poetry, from form to metre, then this is a great next step up. While it provides just a succinct overview of the technical aspects of each form, its true strength lies in offering a wealth of examples that demonstrate these techniques in action. Additionally, it enriches the learning experience with engaging historical context for each form or metre, blending education with storytelling.


* "**Mapping the Heart**" by the poet *Wesley McNair*. Wesley has been on the Pulitzer Committee for Poetry many times, reading and evaluating who will win the Pulitzer for that given year. He’s also a teacher and an important American poet.

* "**Mary Oliver's A Poetry Handbook**" is probably my favorite, and it's super-accessible. Known for her evocative poetry, *Mary Oliver* provides a concise and accessible guide to reading and writing poetry. She explores various aspects, including imagery, sound, and form, and shares her wisdom on how to deepen one's understanding and appreciation of poetry. +++

  > If it’s some gentle beginner’s guidance on how to write a poem you’re after, Mary Oliver should be able to provide you with what you’re looking for with this useful handbook.
  > Here you’ll find her breakdown of poetry’s basics – from different poetic forms and language techniques to practical tips on the creative process – like the importance of workshopping your pieces and the value solitude can bring to your writing too.
  > The latter is something many poets swear by, including Carol Ann Duffy. “I’ve learnt to value silence. I’ve learnt to value thinking, reading, contemplating, rather than rushing straight to the blank page,” she says in her BBC Maestro poetry course.

It covers various aspects, including form, meter, rhyme, and poetic devices, offering practical exercises and examples.

* "**The Poetry Home Repair Manual**", by *Ted Kooser*, is similarly approachable, in a somewhat grandfatherly way. Very re-readable and affirming at times. Ted Kooser is a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and former United States poet laureate. It’s a really good, accessible, “reader-friendly” book (and it’s short, and inexpensive too!). Not dry and “academic” at all. It’s really designed for total beginners (although experienced poets can get something out of it, too, I think). I think you’d find it very helpful. It’s a good place to start, and you can go from there. And by all means, read as much really good poetry as you can. No one who never read the best poets of all time ever wrote good poetry. (Start with the basics, like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, E. E. Cummings, Anne Sexton, and many others!) +++

* "**The Poetry Home Repair Manual** - Practical Advice for Beginning Poets" by *Ted Kooser*: This book offers practical guidance and inspiration for aspiring poets. It covers topics such as finding ideas, refining language, and developing one's unique voice, while providing examples and exercises to help readers improve their craft.

* "**Poetry in the Making**" by *Ted Hughes*.

  > Now, this book is not so much a ‘How to Write Poetry’ book. At Least that isn't why it made it to this video. The reason this is an honourable mention is because 1) Much like the precious book, this has an incredible array of poems in it which are used to demonstrate what Hughes is talking about. But the biggest reason this book is here is because it talks about certain aspects of the poet’s lifestyle. For example, how to think like a poet and how to write about people, and landscapes.


* "**Poetry Writer's Handbook**", by *Sophia Blackwell*, offers a beacon for contemporary poets. This handbook is replete with modern insights and practical advice for today's poetic adventurers, from developing your unique voice to finding your place in the literary world.

If you’re a hobbyist poet, this may not make it into your library, but if you’re looking to make a name for yourself in the community, or even go as far as becoming a working or career poet, then this is an absolute must-have and I’d be surprised if you had any questions that weren’t answered in here.

  Makes it healthy, wealthy, and wise.

* The Eagle (*Alfred, Lord Tennyson*, 1809-1892)

  ```
  He clasps the crag with crooked hands;
  Close to the sun in lonely lands,
  Ringed with the azure world, he stands.

  The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
  He watches from his mountain walls,
  And like a thunderbolt he falls
  ```

* The Immortal Part (*A. E. Housman*, 1859-1936)

* Limericks collection (*Anonymous*)

  ```
  A dozen, a gross, and a score
  Plus three times the square root of four
    Divided by seven
    Plus five times eleven
  Is nine squared and not a bit more.

  A limerick is not hard to define
  But it needs to do more than just rhyme
    It is the meter that matters
    The pitters and patters
  If not you’re just wasting my time

  God’s plan made a hopeful beginning.
  But man spoiled his chances by sinning.
    We trust that the story
    Will end in God’s glory,
  But at present the other side’s winning.

  I sat next the Duchess at tea.
  It was just I feared it would be:
    Her rumblings abdominal
    Were simply abominable.
  And everyone thought it was me.

  There once was a man from Peru
  who dreamed he was eating his shoe.
    He woke with a fright
    in the middle of the night
  to find that his dream had come true.

  There was a young lady of Lynn
  Who was so uncommonly thin
    That when she essayed
    To drink lemonade
  She slipped through the straw and fell in.
  ```

* The Old House (*Walter de la Mare*, 1873-1956)

  ```
  A very, very old house I know --
  And ever so many people go,
  Past the small lodge, forlorn and still,
  Under the heavy branches, till
  Comes the blank wall, and there's the door.
  Go in they do; come out no more.
  No voice says aught; no spark of light
  Across that threshold cheers the sight;
  Only the evening star on high
  Less lonely makes a lonely sky,
  As, one by one, the people go into
  That very old house I know
  ```

* Snowy Evening, The Night Before Christmas (*Robert Frost*)

  ```
  The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
  But I have promises to keep,
  And miles to go before I sleep,
  And miles to go before I sleep.
  ```

* Sound and Sense (*Alexander Pope*, 1688-1744)

  ```
  True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,
  As those move easiest who have learned to dance.
  'Tis not enough no harshness gives offense,
  The sound must seem an echo to the sense:
  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,
  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;
  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,
  The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar;
  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
  The line too labors, and the words move slow;
  Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,
  Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main.
  Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,
  And bid alternate passions fall and rise!
  ```

* Somehow "misquoted" _John Muir_:

  ```
  Into the forest I go / to lose my mind and find my soul
  ```

#### **The Poetry's Play**, by [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) [&uArr;](#home)

  ```
  A verse begins not just with words,
  But syllables like songs of birds.
  A vowel gives it breath and tone,
  A consonant makes bone from stone.

  Some beats are accented, strong and proud,
  While others whisper, soft—— not loud.
  The accentuation makes it glide,
  With stresses rising like a tide.

  This line’s an iamb: soft then strong——
  It’s heartbeat-paced, it hums along.
  But flip it round: a trochee starts
  With thunder drums and dancing hearts.

  A dactyl gallops—— DUM-da-da,
  Like “elephant” or “Canada.”
  While anapest goes light-light-BOOM,
  It sneaks up fast and fills the room.
  Spondees stomp like boots on stone:
  DUM-DUM, with weight, a granite tone.
  Pyrrhics whisper—— soft and slight,
  Two unstressed steps in fading light.

  Then comes amphibrach, da-DUM-da, a mid-rise blend,
  Like deCISive or reLIable friend.
  A cretic (or amphimacer): DUM-da-DUM,
  Like bold and true or love shall live.
  While molossus, DUM-DUM-DUM, roars all through——
  Like Bang! Bang! Bang!—— it's coming for you!
  A four-beat shape? Try paeon next,
  With one strong stress, the rest unflexed.

  We count our feet: this math is meter.
  Scansion marks the pulse, makes it neater.
  The lines are built in meter’s name:
  Trimeter's three feet in a frame.
  With four, it’s tetrameter’s cheer;
  And pentameter—— Shakespeare’s dear.
  Six feet? Then hexameter makes its play——
  Like Homer’s Greek epics far away.

  We shape these lines in stanza’s form,
  Some square and tight, some loose and warm.
  A refrain returns like memory’s tune——
  The echoing cry beneath the moon.

  Couplets rhyme in pairs so tight,
  Like day is done / the fading light.
  A tercet gives us three in line,
  A quatrain four—— it feels just fine.

  A quintet, sestet, septet, grow,
  And octave brings the formal show.
  The sonnet holds its fourteen frame,
  Shakespearean or Petrarchan name.

  Let’s add some music—— rhyme in pairs:
  “Moon” and “tune” like dancing flares.
  A masculine rhyme hits strong and neat:
  “Sky” with “fly” makes the close complete.
  But feminine rhyme, with an extra fall,
  Like “falling” and “calling,” softens all.

  There’s alliteration—— sound repeat:
  Softly sighs the summer heat.
  Alliteration brings sound alive:
  With consonants like “crickets cry.”
  While assonance lets vowels chime,
  In “high tide’s time,” it sings through rhyme.
  Consonance repeats in scattered place——
  Like “blank bank’s bark” in a quiet space.

  Onomatopoeia shouts or drips——
  Like bang!, whirr, or slish-slosh lips.
  Caesura, in two, breaks a line——
  Like "To err is human // to forgive, divine".
  Enjambment spills without a pause:
  The line moves on without a clause.

  Rhyme may be masculine (one strong beat):
  Confess / redress—— so bold, complete.
  Or feminine, two beats that fall:
  Ending / bending, soft and small.

  We scan the lines with scansion's lore,
  To mark the stress and check the score.
  The whole is called prosody, dear——
  The music wrapped in what you hear.

  Scan it all with scansion’s grace,
  Mark feet and beats in every place.
  Feel the rhythm, fast or slow,
  It’s prosody that makes it flow.

  Some poems have a refrain to bind——
  “Nevermore,” the Raven’s mind.
  And prosody? The name for all——
  The art of how the rhythms fall.

  Free verse plays loose—— no strict beat.
  Blank verse has meter, but no rhyme to meet.
  From limericks and odes to epic lines,
  Each form reveals poetic signs.

  So here’s a poem on poetry made——
  With terms and tunes in bright parade.
  From pitch and beat, just trust the sound,
  And let your language dance around.
  ```

<a name="copilot"></a>
#### **A Poet's Primer, in Poetic Time**, by [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) [&uArr;](#home)

  ```
  A poem begins where the silence breaks,
  With accented beats that the breathing makes.
  In verse we trust, each syllable weighed,
  Where vowel and consonant dances are played.

  An iambus is light then strong in tone,
  Like “To be or not”—— you are not alone.
  Iambs arise like a heart that’s ticking,
  Spondees stomp with boots a-kicking.
  Anapest, bold with a runaway pace,
  Outruns the others in sprinting grace.
  Anapest scampers, da-da-DUM, it goes,
  While dactyl dives deep in tripping rows.

  Accentuation lifts the beat——
  A trochee trips with tumbling feet.
  A trochaic foot has a marching start,
  “Tyger Tyger” burns with fiery heart.
  Choree, its twin from another name,
  Still stamps out rhythm just the same.
  A pyrrhic sneaks in softly, slight,
  While dactyls gallop with airy delight.
  An amphibrach wraps with a hug so neat——
  da-DUM-da, like a whisper you just can’t repeat.
  Cretic punches in DUM-da-DUM style,
  Bold in its strut with a double-mile.
  Molossus booms with a triple stress——
  DUM-DUM-DUM sound in a heavy dress.

  Now enter paeon, the scholar's delight,
  With one strong beat where the others are light.
  So many feet make metrical stew——
  Dibrachs hide where the accents flew.

  Couplets rhyme in married pair,
  A kiss of words, light as air.
  Tercets, threes with a flowing grace,
  Quatrains square off in a balanced space.

  Quintets, sestets, keep the climb,
  Septets, octaves stretch to time.
  Each stanza, a room with its own set of rules,
  Where scansion uncovers the architect’s tools.

  With trimeter’s light and tetrameter’s sway, Pentameter rules what the greats often say.
  Hexameter, grand, in epics you'll see——
  A rhythmic line fit for Homer or sea.

  Scansion maps the rising tide,
  Where prosody and pitch collide.
  Rhythm throbs like a pulse in song,
  Pulling the stanza clean along.

  A refrain repeats what we wish to retain,
  A chorus returned, again and again.
  Masculine rhymes, they end quite bold,
  While feminine rhymes let the rhythm unfold.

  Assonance, vowels hum in tune,
  Like “low moan” or “blue noon moon.”
  Assonance hums with inner rhyme,
  "Light of the fire, dying in time."
  And consonance clicks in the echoing night,
  "Blank bark cracked by frostbite’s bite."
  Consonance clicks when the harsh sounds cling,
  As “black clocks” strike with icy ring.

  Alliteration starts a sound parade:
  "Flickering flames in forests fade."
  Masculine rhymes land firm at the tail,
  "Boom" and "doom" in their thunderous gale.
  Feminine rhymes like a dancer’s delight,
  "Falling" and "calling" float feather-light.

  So here's a poem, a toolkit in line,
  To show how mechanics and magic combine.
  Read it aloud—— let meter unroll,
  And find where the beats of a poem take hold.

  Let every refrain be a bell we can ring,
  A memory folded in poems we sing.
  Let every poet—— young, ancient, or new——
  Feel how the Muse threads her logic through you.

  Prosody’s canvas is pitch and pace,
  Rhythm the soul, and rhyme the lace.
  And there, where theory and magic conspire——
  A poem ignites with linguistic fire.
  ```

<a name="claude"></a>
#### **The Poet's Codex: Learning Through Verse**, by [Claude.Ai](https://claude.ai/) [&uArr;](#home)

  ```
  1: The Building Blocks
  Consonant meets vowel in harmony sweet,
  Each syllable dancing to rhythm's beat.
  The verse unfolds with prosody's art,
  Where sound and sense play equal part.

  2: The Music of Language
  Alliteration loves to link and play——
  "Softly sighing summer's day."
  Assonance echoes through the night,
  "The light bright kite takes flight."
  Consonance binds the ending sounds,
  "The wind behind the blind man rounds."

  3: The Heartbeat of Poetry
  Iamb steps forward, weak then strong (ba-DUM),
  "Be-FORE the DAY is DONE."
  Trochee stomps with heavy start (DUM-ba),
  "TI-ger, TI-ger, burn-ing BRIGHT."
  Anapest gallops three by three (ba-ba-DUM),
  "In the NIGHT, by the LIGHT of the moon."

  4: More Rhythmic Feet
  Dactyl dances, strong then weak twice over (DUM-ba-ba),
  "HON-or-ing, GATH-er-ing, WHIS-per-ing."
  Spondee pounds with equal weight (DUM-DUM),
  "STOP! LOOK! NIGHT-MARE! HEART-BREAK!"
  Pyrrhic whispers soft and light (ba-ba),
  "In the shadow of the night."

  5: Measuring the Lines
  Trimeter counts its three-beat song,
  Tetrameter marches four beats strong,
  Pentameter walks with five in line,
  Hexameter flows with six divine.
  Scansion marks each foot's true place,
  Revealing rhythm's measured grace.

  6: The Art of Sound and Stress
  Masculine rhyme ends with power——
  "Tower" meets "shower" in the hour.
  Feminine endings dance with two——
  "Singing" pairs with "ringing" true.
  Accentuation shows us where
  The pitch rises in the air.

  7: The Binding Elements
  Rhyme connects both far and near,
  Making music for the ear.
  Refrain returns again, again,
  A chorus binding joy and pain.
  Like this line that will repeat:
  "Poetry makes language sweet."

  8: The Complete Art
  Now see how consonant and vowel combine,
  How syllables build each crafted line.
  Alliteration, assonance, consonance too,
  Prosody binds them all for you.
  From iamb to trochee, anapest to dactyl,
  Each foot makes rhythm more tactile.
  Trimeter, tetrameter, pentameter flow,
  While scansion reveals what poets know.
  In every stanza, every verse,
  These elements help us rehearse
  The ancient art of word and sound——
  Where poetry makes language sweet.
  (The refrain comes round!)

#### **The Poet's Grand Bazaar** (_An Encyclopedic Romp Through Versification_) by [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/) [&uArr;](#home)

  ```
  Listen close now, budding bard, unlock the verse's gate,
  Where consonant and vowel meet, deciding word and fate.
  A syllable is each small beat, a pulse within the line,
  Some light, some heavy, quick or slow, a rhythmic, shifting sign.
  A verse begins not just with words,
  But syllables like songs of birds.
  A consonant makes bone from stone,
  A vowel gives it breath and tone.

  Accentuation stamps the beat——
  Which sound will rise? Which sound's discreet?
  Some beats are accented, strong and proud,
  While others whisper, soft—— not loud.
  In couplets first, two lines that rhyme:
  The accented beats keep perfect time.
  To map this pulse, we scansion make, with marks for stressed and weak,
  Revealing feet that march along, the rhythm that we seek.

  An iamb (da-DUM) steps gently forth, like "the sun sets low",
  A trochee (DUM-da) leads the charge, like "flowers start to grow".
  The spondee (DUM-DUM) STRONG STRESS commands, "TRUE BLUE", beyond compare!
  The pyrrhic (da-da) whispers soft, two light steps barely there.
  An anapest (da-da-DUM) rebounds, "to the beat of the drum";
  A dactyl (DUM-da-da) gallops free, "merrily we roam".

  Some feet get strange, beyond the norm,
  Like creatures weathering a storm:
  Amphibrach (da-DUM-da) delightful skip!
  "The Assyr*i*an came down..." on swift ships dip.
  The cretic (DUM-da-DUM) HEAR it thump?
  "BREAK, again, BREAK!" on cold grey stone's wet rump.
  The molossus (DUM-DUM-DUM) DEEP DARK DOOM!
  A triple accented crashing boom!
  The paeon (DUM-da-da-da) running free,
  Or (da-DUM-DUM-DUM) like "in *a* wild hurricane's spree".
  Choree (DUM-da) = trochee, swift and keen,
  Dibrach (da-da) two lights, barely seen.

  Next count the feet within the line, the meter finds its name:
  Trimeter has three bold beats, igniting passion's flame.
  Tetrameter brings four strong strides, a common, steady pace,
  Pentameter (five feet!) holds court in time and measured grace.
  Hexameter (six feet!) rolls long, like waves upon the sand ––
  The building blocks of music made by structure's careful hand.

  But sound's not just in stressed attack, it sings in other ways:
  Alliteration links first consonants through phrase on phrase
  ("Simple sounds seek sweetness", see the 's' begin to play?).
  Assonance repeats the vowel tones, holding sound at bay
  ("Hold the coal", the 'o' rings deep, a resonant display).
  Consonance finds kindred consonants, though vowels may decay
  ("Strike a strong string", 'str' echoes, pushing words astray).

  Then rhyme arrives, the chiming end, where matching sounds align:
  One stressed syllable: "light" meets "night,
  Masculine rhyme ("cat/hat") snaps tight;
  Stressed, then unstressed: "ending" with "pretending",
  Feminine rhyme ("drowning/frowning") takes flight.
  Enjambment flows where thoughts don't end –
  Like Milton's lines that break and bend.
  A refrain circles back again, its message never ending,
  A line repeated, like a bell, its constant tone ascending.

  Now build your house! A stanza forms:
  Couplets (two lines): where matching thought warms.
  "True wit is Nature to advantage dressed,
  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed."
  Tercets (three lines): weave thoughts as one,
  Or quatrains (four): the work's half done!
  Quintets (five), sestets (six), septets (seven) grow,
  An octave (eight): a sonnet's starting glow.
  The accentuation shifts, the pitch can rise or fall,
  Prosody (the art of sound!) controls and masters all.

  So wield your lines with conscious craft, let every choice be known,
  These tools and etc.eras help the poet's seeds be sown.
  For rhythm, rhyme, and sound combined create the vital spark,
  The verse that moves, the music found within the poem's dark.
  From cretic's thump to paeon's race,
  Prosody is time and space!

  In verses where our thoughts entwine,
  Let prosody's sweet art define
  The rhythm of each flowing line.
  A stanza forms, a thought complete,
  With measured scansion, oh so neat.
  Perhaps a couplet, paired and tight,
  Or tercet's three, a hopeful light.
  A quatrain strong, a classic form,
  Through changing moods, it weathers storm.
  A quintet dances, five in glee,
  While sestet holds complexities.
  A septet weaves a longer thread,
  An octave's fullness, finely spread.

  The vowel sings, a vibrant sound,
  While consonant surrounds it round.
  Each syllable, a beat, a sign,
  With varied pitch, a sweet design.
  And hear the accentuation strong,
  Where accented notes precisely throng.

  An iamb is soft, "da-DUM," it goes,
  Like morning's breath, a gentle rose.
  A trochee drops, "DUM-da," it falls,
  Responding to the muse's calls.
  The anapest, "da-da-DUM", a quickening pace,
  A joyful chase in time and space.
  Then dactyl, "DUM-da-da" strides free,
  A triple beat for you and me.
  A spondee, slow, "da-DUM" it stands,
  With emphasis in willing hands.
  While pyrrhic whispers, "da-da" light,
  Its presence subtle, soft, and slight.

  For iambus read 'iamb,' you see,
  And trochaic is 'trochee' for me.
  Choree's a trochee, in some old lore,
  And dibrach means two unstressed, no more,
  Like 'da-da,' light, as pyrrhic shows,
  The subtle currents, as verse flows.

  New feet appear, for varied strain:
  The amphibrach, "da-DUM-da," again,
  Like "to mar·ket to · mar·ket," light.
  The cretic, "DUM-da-DUM", a forceful bite,
  It sounds like "fire · light · bright."
  The molossus, three stresses in a row,
  Like "dark · night · storm," a heavy flow.
  The paeon, four, one stress so grand,
  A varied rhythm close at hand.

  When alliteration starts to play,
  Like "whispering winds" along the way,
  The same sound starts, a charming art,
  Engaging mind and eager heart.
  And assonance, a chiming sound,
  Like "light bright skies" on hallowed ground,
  Repeats the vowel, a gentle hum,
  Before the closing words do come.

  Then consonance begins to weave,
  Like "black specked track," you will believe,
  A repetition, soft and deep,
  Of consonant sounds, secrets to keep.
  The refrain, a line that comes again,
  A whispered echo, now and then,
  To emphasize, to make it clear,
  A thought or feeling held so dear.

  We speak of lines, how they combine:
  A trimeter has three lines, divine.
  A tetrameter, with four beats strong,
  Where melodies and thoughts belong.
  A pentameter, with five it flies,
  As Shakespeare's noble verse implies:
  "Shall I · compare · thee to · a sum·mer's day?"
  A perfect example, come what may.
  And hexameter, with six it gleams,
  Like epic tales and waking dreams.

  The rhyme concludes, a joyful chime,
  In perfect synchrony with time.
  A masculine one, strong and bold,
  Like "day" and "play," a story told.
  A feminine one, with gentle grace,
  Like "flowing" and "going," in its place,
  Two syllables, the second soft,
  A whispered echo, borne aloft.

  A limerick with wit and zest,
  Its "AABBA" rhyme, a playful test:
  There once · was a man · from Naga·saki,
  Whose poems · were not · very tack·y.
  He wrote · them with glee,
  For the world · to see,
  And his meter · was never · quite lack·y.

  So this verse, a lesson clear,
  Explains the art we hold so dear.
  From rhythm's pulse to rhyme's sweet end,
  A poem's magic, our true friend.
  A verse for learning, light and free,
  The grandest tapestry for thee!

  In prosody's realm, where words alight,
  We weave a tapestry of sound and light.
  Each syllable, a tiny, measured beat,
  Guiding our rhythm, bittersweet.
  The vowel's open song, a flowing grace,
  While consonant defines its very space.
  Hear pitch ascend, a note held high or low,
  And accentuation makes the meaning glow.
  A word accented, bold and standing clear,
  Dispelling doubt, removing every fear.

  A stanza forms, a thought contained and neat,
  From couplet's pair to octave's full retreat.
  A tercet often three, a gentle chime,
  Then quatrain strong, conquering space and time.
  A quintet's five, a playful, lively bound,
  While sestet brings conclusions all around.
  A septet stretches, gathering the theme,
  Before the verse fulfills its waking dream.

  Now scansion calls, our guide through patterned ways,
  To mark the feet in poetry's vast maze.
  The iamb strolls, "da-DUM," a steady pace,
  (Or iambus called in time and place).
  The trochee falls, "DA-dum," a downward trend,
  (Trochaic's nature, to the very end).
  The choree too, another name you'll find,
  For trochee's sister, for the musing mind.
  The anapest skips, "da-da-DUM," so fleet,
  "Twas the night · before · Christmas," oh so sweet!
  The dactyl gallops, "DA-dum-dum," with might,
  "Hick-o-ry · dick-o-ry · dock," how it takes flight!
  The spondee lands, "DA-DUM," with solemn sound,
  Like "cold · stones" laid upon the hallowed ground.
  The pyrrhic flits, "da-da," a whispered grace,
  Two unstressed beats, lost in time and space.
  (Dibrach, by some, for this light step is known,
  Two "x" marks, where no strong stress is sown.)

  More feet arrive, to stretch the poetic art:
  The amphibrach, "x / x," a beating heart,
  "To mar·ket to · mar·ket," a subtle sway,
  A central stress upon its gentle way.
  The cretic strikes, "/ x /," a forceful blend,
  Like "true · love · true," until the very end.
  The molossus, "///," three stresses in a line,
  "Deep · dark · night," its power truly fine.
  The paeon, four, with just one stress held grand,
  A varied pulse across the poetic land.

  When alliteration starts to gleam,
  Like "slippery snakes," a shimmering stream,
  The same sound starts, a charming, whispered art,
  Engaging mind and eager, beating heart.
  And assonance, a chiming, inner grace,
  Like "mellow wedding bells" in time and space,
  Repeats the vowel, a sweet, recurring hum,
  Before the closing phrases gently come.

  Then consonance begins its subtle play,
  Like "pitter-patter," at the close of day,
  A repetition, soft and deep, unseen,
  Of consonant sounds, where shadows convene.
  The refrain, a line that comes again,
  A whispered echo, now and then,
  To emphasize, to make the meaning clear,
  A thought or feeling held profoundly dear.

  We speak of lines, how many beats they hold:
  A trimeter has three, a story told.
  A tetrameter, with four strong steps it strides,
  Where classic tales and easy rhythm glides.
  A pentameter, with five it grandly flies,
  As Shakespeare's noble verse often implies:
  "A rose · by an·y oth·er name · would smell · as sweet."
  A measured rhythm, wonderfully complete.
  And hexameter, with six it brightly gleams,
  Like epic voyages and waking dreams.

  The rhyme concludes, a joyful, perfect chime,
  Connecting lines, defying passing time.
  A masculine one, strong and bold and brief,
  Like "day" and "play," bringing quick relief.
  A feminine one, with gentle, soft embrace,
  Like "flowing" and "going," in its proper place,
  Two syllables, the second soft and light,
  A whispered echo in the fading night.

  So this long poem, a lesson clear and bright,
  Explains the art that fills the soul with light.
  From rhythm's pulse to rhyme's sweet, whispered end,
  Poetic magic, our forever friend.
  May this verse help, in every single way,
  To light your path through poetry's grand display!

  Poetry’s pulse, a verse of vibrant sound,
  Each syllable a step where dreams are found.
  Vowels sing clear, their pitch a soaring flight,
  Consonants clash, with accented delight.

  Iambus, soft, da-DUM, the heart’s own beat,
  “To be or not to be,” Hamlet’s repeat.
  In pentameter, five iambs gently glide,
  A couplet seals the rhyme, with love as guide.

  Trochee, or choree, DUM-da, bold and spry,
  “Tyger, Tyger, burning bright,” Blake’s cry.
  Trochaic tetrameter, four steps in stride,
  Masculine rhyme, like “night,” cuts sharp with pride.

  Anapest, da-da-DUM, leaps light and free,
  “And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,”
  Byron’s quatrain, in rhythm wild and grand,
  Assonance hums, with “sheen” and “sea” at hand.

  Dactyl, DUM-da-da, sways in lilting fall,
  “Half a league, half a league,” Tennyson’s call.
  Hexameter rolls, a six-beat mighty wave,
  Consonance links, with “league” sounds that engrave.

  Spondee, DUM-DUM, stomps heavy, loud, and sure,
  “Out, out,” cries Macbeth, with grief’s allure.
  Pyrrhic, or dibrach, da-da, soft and fleet,
  In trimeter, it dances, light on feet.

  Amphibrach, da-DUM-da, swings with gentle grace,
  “The night was alive with a song in its place.”
  Cretic, DUM-da-DUM, bold in measured tone,
  Molossus, DUM-DUM-DUM, thunders on its own.

  Paeon, DUM-da-da-da, a playful, skipping air,
  In limerick form, it laughs without a care:
  “A poet from Stratford did write,
  With alliteration so bright,
  His verse sparkled fair!”

  Tercet, three lines, or quintet, five in song,
  Sestet, six, or septet, seven strong,
  Octave, eight, crafts a sonnet’s stately frame,
  Prosody weaves their rhythm, none the same.

  Refrain returns, a chant to bind the heart,
  “Do not go gentle,” Thomas’ fiery art.
  Scansion charts the feet, the stress, the flow,
  Accentuation lifts where words must grow.

  Feminine rhyme, like “dancing” and “prancing,”
  Softens the close, with extra syllables glancing.
  Stanza and rhyme, the poet’s joyful play,
  Sing poetry’s song through night and day.
